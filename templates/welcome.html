        <h1>Overview of the Project</h1>
            <p>Buying a house can be a very exhausting process, there is a great variety of houses, many factors that can cause the price of a house to increase or decrease, it may be located in an area that you like or that you do not like so much, there are simply so many factors that must be taken into consideration before being able to buy a house according to the budget that one has. </p>
            <p>For this project we will try to predict the value of houses in the state of Iowa and more specifically in the Ames area. Our dataset consists of 79 variables that describe in detail the characteristics of the houses in this state. We will apply different machine learning models with the hope of having the best possible accuracy when predicting the value of houses.</p>
            <p>The main reasons for choosing this topic was wanting to know a little more about how the home market works and to test our knowledge of machine learning, we believe that it is a good test for us to know what kind of models we should work with and In addition to this, what kind of treatment should we give to the data.</p>
